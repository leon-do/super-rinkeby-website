## Presentation of ideas for scaling microtransactions:

Scaling microtransactions on the blockchain remains a challenge today. We developed five ideas that would help with scaling on the blockchain including:
Sharding 2.0 - dedicated nodes to validating DApp-specific data
Community-centric validation - Each game download would include a node download. Gamers can decide if they want to toggle their node capacity on/off and depending on how much storage they want to provide. Gamers who participate will receive more in-game points.
